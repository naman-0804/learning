# Learning Repository

This is my personal space for learning and experimenting with code. I use this repository to try things out, practice programming, and keep track of what I learn. There’s no specific structure—just a collection of code snippets, experiments, and anything else I’m working on as I learn.

## What you'll find here

- Practice code and experiments
- Random ideas and tests

## How to use

Feel free to look around, but this repo is mainly for my own learning. Nothing here is guaranteed to be finished or polished.

Just coding and having fun!
